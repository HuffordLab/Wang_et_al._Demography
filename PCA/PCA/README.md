# This folder contains two methods to do the Principle Component Analysis (PCA).
* PCA with [ngsCovar](https://github.com/mfumagalli/ngsPopGen), which can take the aligned bam file as input in ANGSD to generate the genotype posterior probability file to feed in ngsCovar.
* PCA with [GCTA](http://cnsgenomics.com/software/gcta/), which starts from the SNP data set. 
This method is used to do the PCA for the SEEDS data.
