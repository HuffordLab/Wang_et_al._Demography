This analysis is to examine the count of derive homozygous and heterozygous sites among populations.

#First, use the angsd_SNPcall.sh to calculate the derived allele frequency with Angsd

#Second, use 20150519_derivedHomoSites.sh or 20150729_derivedHeteroSites.sh to count the corresponding genotypes in each individual.

#Third, do the boxplot with the R scripts.
